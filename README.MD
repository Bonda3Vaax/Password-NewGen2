# Password-NewGen

## Info

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

I have attempted this project to better understand the vast use of JavaScript.

I have learned to declare variables, use operators, add event listeners, use functions, loops and methods.

I have a better understanding of the JavaScript grammar however when it comes to the practical part, there is a lot of information to remember, therefore more time and practise is required to master it. 

This project helped sharpening my skills and had fun doing it.
